    <h1>Kelp Fries üçü</h1>

    <p>What's a burger without fries? Crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside!
        Crazy, good deliciousness :) </p>
   
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 Medium Russet Potatoes</li>
        <li>Oil Of Your Choice</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Vinegar - 15mL per 1 liter of water (1 tbsp to 4 cups water)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Set a pot of water over high heat and bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Peel and cut the potatoes into 1/4 inch thick strips.</li>
        <li>Add 2 large pinches of salt, vinegar, and potatoes to the boiling water.
            Boil until the potatoes are fully tender but not falling apart, about 10 minutes. 
            Set a paper-towel-lined baking sheet on the right.</li>
        <li>Drain and spread the potatoes on the paper-towel-lined baking sheet. 
            Allow to dry for at least 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the oil to a large wok and bring to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. 
            Meanwhile, set up the fry station by placing the boiled fries on the left and another paper towel-lined 
            baking sheet to the right of the wok.</li>
        <li>Separate the fries into three small batches. 
            Using a spider or slotted spoon, gently lower the fries into the hot oil. 
            Fry each batch for 50 seconds (set a timer) and let drain on the separate paper towel-lined baking sheet. 
            Repeat the process for the remaining two batches and let the fries cool for 30 minutes or in the freezer before the second fry. </li>
        <li>Return the oil to 400 degrees Fahrenheit over high heat.
            Meanwhile set up the fry station by placing the potatoes on the left, and a metal bowl with a paper towel on the right.</li>
        <li>Gently lower half of the fries into the hot oil. 
            Fry until they are crisp, lightly golden brown and floating, about 3 to 4 minutes. 
            Drain the fries, move to the paper towel-lined bowl and immediately season with salt. 
            The cooked fries can be kept hot and crisp on a wire rack set on a baking sheet in a 200¬∞F oven while you cook the second batch. 
            Enjoy.</li>
